Full Stack Project Overview
Architecture
In my full stack project, I implemented various types of frontend development, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA). Express HTML is useful for rendering dynamic content from the server, allowing for faster server-side rendering. JavaScript, on the other hand, is versatile and facilitates interactivity and asynchronous functions within the frontend. When comparing Express HTML with SPAs, the key difference lies in user experience—SPAs are much more responsive as they load a single HTML page and dynamically update content as the user interacts with the app, rather than refreshing the entire page with every new request.

The backend utilized a NoSQL MongoDB database because it efficiently handles unstructured data and scales horizontally across many servers. MongoDB's flexibility was particularly beneficial for my project, as it allowed for dynamic schema design, making it easy to evolve the data model as the application grew.

Functionality
JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, differs from JavaScript in that it is a lightweight data format used for transmitting data between the frontend and backend. While JavaScript is a programming language, JSON is primarily a way to represent data in a human-readable format that both the client and server can interpret. In my project, JSON tied together the frontend and backend by sending and receiving data through APIs in a consistent, structured format, which allowed the frontend to display dynamic content based on the backend's responses.

During the development process, I refactored several parts of the code to improve both functionality and efficiency. For example, I identified opportunities to reduce redundancy by creating reusable UI components. These reusable components not only helped in maintaining cleaner code but also allowed for easier updates and more consistent user experiences across the application.

Testing
Request and retrieval methods are critical in a full stack application, particularly when dealing with various types of API testing. In my project, I tested API endpoints to ensure that data was being correctly requested and retrieved. One challenge was managing security layers, such as authentication and authorization, which added complexity to testing. Understanding methods and endpoints was essential for creating a reliable application—whether it was GET requests to retrieve data or POST requests to send data, each needed to be thoroughly tested to ensure security and functionality.

Reflection
This course has been instrumental in helping me progress toward my professional goals. Through hands-on experience, I have learned, developed, and mastered several key skills, such as full stack development using JavaScript and MongoDB. Additionally, my understanding of backend architecture and frontend design has grown, making me a more marketable candidate in the software development field. These skills, combined with the ability to write efficient, scalable code and secure full stack applications, will be invaluable as I pursue a career in software development.
